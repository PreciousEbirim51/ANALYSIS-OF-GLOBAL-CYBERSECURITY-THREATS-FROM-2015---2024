INTRODUCTION
The decade from 2015 to 2024 witnessed unprecedented evolution in cybersecurity threats, driven by rapid digital transformation, geopolitical tensions, and technological advancements. This analysis examines the major trends, threat actors, attack vectors that characterized this transformative period in cybersecurity.

PRE ANALYSIS

A pre-analysis phase was conducted to establish an analytical framework before the creation of the dashboard. This pre-analysis phase involves:
Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.

Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing during the analysis.

Potential Insights: I was able to uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.

Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

Microsoft Power BI was the primary analysis and visualization tool used for this project, the Power BI features used include;

DAX Functions

RECOMMENDATION

Strengthen Cybersecurity Policies & Regulations

International Cooperation: Governments should collaborate on cybersecurity treaties to combat cross-border cybercrime.

National Cybersecurity Laws: Enforce strict data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) to hold organizations accountable.

Public-Private Partnerships: Encourage information sharing between governments and corporations to detect threats early.

Enhance Organizational Cybersecurity Measures

Zero Trust Architecture: Implement strict access controls and continuous verification.

Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing: Identify and patch vulnerabilities proactively.

Employee Training: Conduct cybersecurity awareness programs to prevent phishing/social engineering attacks.

Incident Response Plans: Develop and test disaster recovery strategies to minimize damage from breaches.

Adopt Advanced Technologies

AI & Machine Learning: Use AI-driven threat detection to identify anomalies in real time.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all critical systems.

Encryption & Secure Backups: Protect sensitive data with end-to-end encryption and offline backups.

Improve Global Cyber Hygiene

Patch Management: Regularly update software and firmware to fix security flaws.

Secure IoT Devices: Ensure smart devices follow cybersecurity standards.

Public Awareness Campaigns: Educate individuals on safe online practices

(e.g., avoiding suspicious links, strong passwords).

Combat Cybercrime & Disinformation

Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing: Establish global platforms (e.g., INTERPOL's Cybercrime Unit) to track cybercriminal networks.

Counter Ransomware Strategies: Ban ransom payments, enforce cryptocurrency regulations, and improve decryption tools.

Fake News Mitigation: Use AI and fact-checking initiatives to combat cyber-enabled disinformation.

Strengthen Critical Infrastructure Security

Mandatory Security Standards: Enforce cybersecurity compliance for energy, healthcare, and financial sectors.

Redundancy & Resilience: Ensure backup systems for essential services to prevent prolonged outages.

Foster Cybersecurity Workforce Development

Invest in Cyber Education: Train more professionals through universities and certifications (e.g., CISSP, CEH).
Global

Cyber Drills: Conduct simulated cyberattack exercises (like NATO's Cyber Coalition) to improve readiness.

CONCLUSION

The decade from 2015 to 2024 marked a pivotal shift in cybersecurity, transitioning from isolated cybercrime incidents to a complex, globalized threat landscape with far-reaching economic, political, and societal consequences. The cybersecurity landscape will continue to evolve with quantum computing risks, deep fake-driven social engineering, and AI-powered autonomous attacks. Organizations must shift from reactive defense to proactive cyber resilience, integrating threat intelligence, automation, and cross-border collaboration.
